            <li>A simple authorization system (using requests). At some point, we decided to restrict access to the bot
              only to registered users. Now all the new users are required to send a registration request.</li>
            <li>There is also exists an ability to to pay (via telegram stars) for unlimited access. See <a href="#pricing">pricing details</a>.</li>
            <li>Actual audio length calculation (via ffprobe packets list command). Sometimes the generated files
              contain incorrect meta information, in which case the only way out is to get real data using ffprobe.</li>
            <li>Large audio files splitting on-the fly. If the file size exceeds the telegram API limit (50MB), it is
              split into several smaller files before being sent to the user.</li>
            <li>Detecting delays in the processing queue. In this case, repeated messages are periodically (each minute) sent indicating that the request is still being processed.</li>
            <li><strong>Powered by mighty and cute kitties under the hood.</strong></li>
